# Quote Collector: Record and Preserve Famous Quotes

## Project Description
The Quote Collector is a decentralized application designed to record, store, and retrieve famous quotes on the blockchain. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, users can submit their favorite quotes along with their respective authors, ensuring that these words of wisdom are permanently preserved and publicly accessible.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create an immutable and censorship-resistant repository of famous quotes. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to build a transparent and publicly accessible database where anyone can contribute and retrieve historical or inspirational quotes without the risk of loss or manipulation.

## Future Scope
- Implementing a voting system to rank quotes based on popularity.
- Allowing users to categorize quotes based on topics.
- Enabling NFT-based ownership for unique quotes.
- Supporting multi-chain compatibility for broader adoption.
- Integrating a front-end DApp for seamless user interaction.
